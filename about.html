          <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>

          <p>Welcome to my first steps in the world of software engineering and website development. </p>

          <p>I'm a sim racing enthusiast and amateur broadcastor, in fact you'll find me broadcasting various catagories of sim racing every Tuesday, Wednesday
            and Saturday nights on my channel, SimShed Broadcasting. My enthusiasm of the sport runs so deep that I converted my garage into my sim racing 
            and technology hub and am now a part of the USD 12 billion dollar a year eSports industry.
          </p>

          <p>My interest in coding began out of
            necessity when I had to figure out how to change css styles so I could customise the overlays that I was using for my broadcasts. 
            I quickly found that I really enjoyed creating the code to change the appearance of my broadcast overlays, it appealed to my meticulous nature.</p>

          <p>So here I am, in my 50â€™s and a student once more, seems as though you can teach an old dog new tricks after all.</p>
