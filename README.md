# Website-Project
This is my first attempt at building a website from scratch.

I did a fair bit of looking around on YouTube and Google for ideas, eventually finding something that was very close to what I had in mind so it was a matter of understanding what had
been done and modifying the elemenments already there for what I wanted to achieve.

Once I had a basic road map of what I liked and what I wanted I then went about looking for the cleanest way to present my work.
My first job was to create the files that I would use knowing that I would want;
* 2 pages
* A landing page and an "about me" page.
* Picture files
* .png files
* css styles
* javascript

Once I had all my files created I then went to work on pushing them all up to Github and started work on my index html file, saving and checking as I went along.

Once I had each element of my Index file done I then went to my css file and worked on the corresponding styles for each section doing the same with the about html.

The javascript was probably the most daunting task as I wasn't 100% sure on where I should put the code. I had seen more than a few YouTube videos where the creator would
place the javascript code directly into the html file, I figured that was probably okay if you had 2 or 3 lines of code but would probably become a nightmare if you had to do
up an entire page of js code. I decided that I would make a separate file for my js code and link that file back to my html as i figured that might be in keeping with 
developing good work practices.

I was fortunate enough to be able to cut & paste what little js code I had and was able to understand the basic idea behind it, however I'm still struggling to really get
my head around this and feel that this is going to be something I need more help with.

All in all, I was pretty pleased that, (although the basic roadmap was already there), I was able to take an idea that I liked and manipulate it to suit my needs to come up with
a website that would be unique to me.
